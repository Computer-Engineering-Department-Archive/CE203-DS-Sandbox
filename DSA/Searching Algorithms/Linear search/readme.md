# Linear search
Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

## Algorithm
A linear search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds an element that matches the target value. If the algorithm reaches the end of the list, the search terminates unsuccessfully

## Performance
Maximum time to find a matching element is 0(n). The linear search algorithm suits best when a key element matches the first element in the array. And the worst when a key element matches the last element in the array.
