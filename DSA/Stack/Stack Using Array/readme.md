# Stack Using Array
We are going to use the element at the index 1 of the array as the bottom of the stack and the last element of the stack as the top of the stack as described in the picture given below.

We are going to use a pointer which is always going to point the topmost element of the stack. It will point to the element at index 0 when the stack is empty.

We are going to consider only the elements from 1 to S.top as part of the stack. It might be possible that there are other elements also in the array but we are not going to consider them as stack.

To add an item to a stack (push), we just need to increment the top pointer by 1 and add the element there.

Letâ€™s suppose that stack size is the maximum size of the stack. So, if top+1 exceeds stack size, then the stack is **overflowed**. So, we will first check for the overflowing of the stack and then accordingly add the element to it.

Similarly to remove an item from a stack (pop), we will first check if the stack is empty or not. If it is empty, then we will throw an error of **Stack Underflow**, otherwise remove the element from the stack and return it.
